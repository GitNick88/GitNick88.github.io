subtitle: I wrote my first line of code in November 2019

It was the famous 'print('Hello world!')'

I've always wanted to learn how to write code.  Code for doing what, exactly?  Honestly, I don't know - a lot of things.  I've always been fascinated by the idea of automating tasks we do in every day life.  Or, at the very least, taking very complicated tasks and computing them in seconds.

For example, I've owned a restaurant in Cleveland, Ohio for the last four years.  I've always wanted to find efficient ways to measure or quantify data that my small business outputs every year.  Is that possible to do without knowing how to code?  Sure, but it has always required buying a license from someone which can be very expensive.  Even business analytics tools from scftware companies like quickbooks can be useful, but they aren't as customizeable as I'd like them.  Questions like, is there a correlation between the weather outside and my revenue?  These are data points that quickbooks isn't going to provide me.  Imagine what a company, even a small one like mine, could do with that information.

I know, from being an entreprenuer that the things that separate a good business from a great business can be very small competitive advantages, or an edge.  How can a business gain an edge?  In many ways.  One way that I've never been able to utilize, until recently, is create a model that can lend itself to the power of prediction.

I jumped into Lambda School in December 2019 and we created our first predictive model in Unit 2 (month 2) where we used real estate data from New York City to anticipate sale price.  I was hooked.  We studied linear regression, claffication problems, natural language processing and neural networks/deep learning.  We even spent a small amount of time learning software engineering with OOP and SQL where we built a flask app to deploy predictive models on websites.

My entry into data science from Lambda School has given me a skill that I want to apply to the world and help create competitive advantages in different industries.  Please check out a few of the projects that I've done from my posts on my main page.  Thank you!
