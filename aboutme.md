subtitle: I wrote my first line of code in November 2019

I've always wanted to learn how to write code.  Code for doing what, exactly?  Honestly, I don't know - a lot of things.  I've always been fascinated by the idea of automating tasks we do in every day life.  Or, if not automating, making things far more efficient than they are today.

For example, I've owned a restaurant in Cleveland, Ohio for the last four years.  I've always wanted to find efficient ways to measure or quantify data that my small business outputs every year.  Is that possible to do without knowing how to code?  Sure, but it has always required buying a license from someone which can be very expensive.  Even business analytics tools from scftware companies like quickbooks can be useful, but they aren't as customizeable as I'd like them.  Things like, is there a correlation between the weather outside and my revenue?  These are data points that quickbooks isn't going to provide me.

I know, from being an entreprenuer that the things that separate a good business from a great business can be very small competitive advantages, or an edge.  How can a business gain an edge?  In many ways.  I've done it through working closely with my staff and always setting good goals for everyone to achieve.  Doing that has pushed both my employees and myself to grow.  I've seen a lot of progress with this but that said, there has been an edge that I've been unable to tap into.  Studying data science has changed that.
