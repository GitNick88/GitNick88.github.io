###### Detroit Red Wings forward - Pavel Datzyuk


"It's hockey night in hockeytown!"  Those were the words I grew up hearing every other evening with my friends as we'd flip on whatever station would be broadcasting the Detroit, Red Wings games. Some of the best players to ever play the game, played in Detroit as well as it was the home of the original six hockey teams to the National Hockey League (NHL) and naturally, Detroit was eventually dubbed Hockey Town.

Hockey is a great game.  Even for people who don't enjoy sports as much.  The fights, the hitting, the fast pace and the goal scoring all contribute to three exciting periods of glory.  Hockey ran through our blood so much that our parents used to have us watch hockey to feel better:

All joking aside, there are so many facets and strategies to the game.  Not only is the game about strategy but it's all done at a very fast pace.  Oh, and I forgot to mention, it's all done on ice...  Most passes are completed 12 feet from eachother.  Often times slapshots can travel 100+ mph.  Not to mention, the game is full contact.  That's right.  Players slam into eachother skating at full speed.  Sometimes they result in injury and sometimes they receive cheering and applause.  Either way, the two best things about hockey are the hitting/fighting and the goalscoring.  Unfortunately I don't have a dataset on NHL fights but I do have one on goals scored from 2011-2018.

I set out with an anticipation of a few ideas about what I might find in this dataset.  For starters, I thought that wrist shots would be the most accurate goal scoring method.  Here's what a wrist shot looks like:

Did you see how the player sort of dragged the puck from behind him and used his weight as leverage to shoot the puck?  That's what a wrist shot is.  The reason that I thought I'd find the wrist shot the most accurate is because forwards love taking wrist shots.  They're easier to release because often times the puck is already in shooting position when a player is stick handling.  Also, they can be very quick shots which can easily trick a goalie.  Even with these thoughts in mind I came to see that while a lot of goals are scored via the wrist shot, they are not the most accurate shots as my original thoughts lead me.  So what are the most accurate?  What type of shots resulted with the most goals?  Let's talk through several of these questions.  I know that most hockey fans are interested in several different types of data that would come from this dataset so lets dive into these four questions and I will demonstrate my findings through a few visuals:

1) what were the most common shots
2) what shots scored the most goals
3) what were the most accurate shots
4) What position predominantly scores each type of goal

If you're like me, you may be asking these questions.  How could we possibly figure out all of this information?  Good thing the National Hockey League was so generous to publish a dataset for our use.  The dataset is 7068 rows by 42 columns which equates to 296,856 instances recorded!  Don't worry I cleaned and trimmed it down a bit.  I've also used some handy python skills to help us interpret the information rather consicely.  That said, let's start with issue number one...

## 1) What were the most common shots?
The types of shots that are recorded are as follows: wrist shots, backhanded shots, deflected shots, slap shots, snap shots, tipped shots and wraparound shots.  Before we begin the actual analysis from the dataset...  do you have any guesses as to which one was most common?

Before I flipped the switch on datawrangling I guessed that wrist shots were most common.  I played hockey myself for several years.  I was a forward and I played along some fairly talented players and the shot that I was most comfortable taking as a forward was a wrist shot.  Outside of my own experience, I loved watching the likes of Pavel Datsyuk and Henrik Zetterberg and they had lazer like abilities to score with wrist shots.  Even the old legends like Wayne Grezky and Gordie Howe had a wickedly accurate wrist shot.

If you guessed wrist shots like I did, you'd be right!  Here's a visual of the most common shots taken in the NHL from 2011-2018:

![Common Shots](/img/most common shots.PNG)

Look at those numbers!  The chart doesn't show this but the total shots taken totals to 566,171.  On the chart, wrist shots account for 285,420 of those shots with is 50.4%!  That's a lot of wrist shots.  How many of those wrist shots turned into actual goals, you ask?  Let's tackle that next.

## 2) what shots scored the most goals
With a wide variaty of the types of shots we have a few different options.  We already know that wrist shots accounted for 50.4% of all shots taken from 2011 to 2018... but we haven't talked about accuracy yet.  The total amount of goals scored was 50923.  For all we know, wrist shots could only account for a small fraction of those total goals.  We will talk about accuracy next.  For now, take a guess as to which types of shots scored the most goals.  Drum roll please...

![Most goals](/img/Most goals scored.PNG)

If you guessed wrist shots, you were right!  Wrist shots are on a hot streak!  I suppose it makes sense...  Since half of the total shots taken were wrist shots, even if the accuracy is a small number it would still account for a lot of the goals scored since there were 285,420 wrist shots and only 50,923 total goals scored.  Quantity doesn't always gaurantee quality though, as they say.  Let's take a look at our next metric deduced from our dataset: accuracy.

## 3) what were the most accurate shots
The way I look at accuracy is sort of simple.  As long as a shot is put on goal (it either hits the goalie or it scores) then it gets counted in the total shots category.  Then I take the total number of goals scored by the type of shot and divide it by the total number of shots taken by that type.  The equation is simple...  (total goals)/(total shots)...  So for wrist shots, since we've talked so much about them thus far, we have wrist shots scored = 25265 and wrist shots taken = 285420.  With our accuracy equation in mind, we divide 25,265 by 285,420 and we realize that 8.8% of all wrist shots went in.  I'm calling this an accuracy rating because it reflects the likelyhood of wristshots turning into goals.  Of 100 wrist shots taken, roughly 8 to 9 of them go in.  How does that measure up to the other types of shots?  Any guesses?

I remember as a kid having an innate desire to take slap shots at the goalie all the time, thinking that they would be the most likely to go in due to the speed and force at which the puck flies.

I suppose the accuracy rating for slap shots makes since since slap shots are, 1) very hard to pull off, 2) very hard to aim with, 3) take a long time for a defensive player to let a slap shot go.

Clearly the two winners for "accuracy" are deflecte shots.  These are instances where a player will take a shot, and there will be a teamate standing in front of the opposing goalie in hopes to block the goalie's ability to see the puck or even to tip or deflect the direction of the puck at the last minute.  Can you imagine a puck flying at you at 90 mph and it suddenly changes directions 5 feet from you?  Impossible to stop.  The data and the concepts seem to be saying the same thing.  While wrist shots are the most common, the highest scoring, they aren't the most accurate.  When it comes to accuracy, tipped and deflected shots are king.

Onto the distinctions between forward and defensive goals!

## 4) What position predominantly scores each type of goal
Like most games, there are often physical distinctions between types of players.  In football, a lot of good quarterbacks are tall and have very strong arms for throwing.  Most offensive lineman are larger body types because of their need to use their stature to defend and block.  Hockey is similar.  It's fairly typical that forwards are more agile while defensive players are usually more sturdy and weigh more.  These implications can come out in the game play.  Wrist shots, for example, don't necessarily require a lot of body weight to release the puck, where slapshots do.  Knowing that, we might as ourselves who is more likely to take slapshots vs wrist shots or wraparounds vs deflected shots.  Asking these questions gets into the common discussion among hockey enthusists about who scores more goals, forwards or defense?

Let's first look at total goals scored for forwards vs defense

![Most goals](/img/forwards vs defense pie chart.PNG)

The pie chart, for me, visualizes what I expected from the data that forwards tend to score most of the goals.  I ran the numbers and in most cases forwards scored more goals than defenders in every shot type with the exception for slap shots.

## Final Remarks to the directors of the NHL:

In an instance where the board of directors who work for the NHL were to ask for insights from this data sets on how to make games more exciting for views through more goals I would advice on these three things:

1) Encourage players to get more shots on goal. Perhaps focus on shot types that have a high coversion of goal scoring such as deflected and tipped shots.  According to hockey-reference.com the average amount of shots on goal per game in 2018 was 31.3  If players were to find a way to increase the shots by another 4 shots per game that could lead to more goals across the board.
2) Look at the correlation that wrist shots have to goal scoring...  The correlation value is .93 so tell the player "wrist shots, wrist shots, wrist shots!"

![Most goals](/img/wrist shots and goals correlation.PNG)

3) While looking for some anomilies from the data I noticed that the defensive players took 66509 slapshots and only scored 2981 (success rate of 0.2%) goals where forwards took 43726 and scored 3284 goals (success rate of 7.5%).  This was the only category where defense had more shots than offense in any category and yet their success rate was significantly lower.  Why might this be?  Positioning on the ice?  Is it that slap shots are simply not accurate?  Is it that defensive players are taking the shots and the forwards are tipping/deflecting the puck and thereby the forwards are getting credited with the goals instead of the defense?
