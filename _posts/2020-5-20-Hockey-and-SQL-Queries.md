Anyone who knows me knows that I've always loved hockey.  Some of my most vivid memories were trading hockey cards of the best players in the NHL with kids I grew up with on my street.

As a kid, I had great record keeping skills for all of the most valuable cards that I had.  By record keeping, I mean good ol' pen and paper.  Several months ago, I learned about databases and SQL queries.  Perfect!

I built a few different projects that would demonstrate the infinite amount of use cases for databases and SQL queries.  The project that I started with in learning how to query a database in python was with bookstore data.  Cool!

I wanted to create an app that could be utilized on my desktop that had a user interface.  So here's a copy of the user interface that I created using a python library called tkinter.

The application is very simple.  Originally I had plans to create multiple functions for the app but I decided all that I needed for now was a simple method for keeping record of the player's name, team, total career goals and years played in the National Hockey League.

I created a simple backend of the application in VSCode - with all of the functions of the app.

From there I created a very simple frontend.py file to be the face of the program.  Any time I get the sense of wanting to add players to the database as a list of my all time favorite players, I can through the simple GUI.

More functionality to come!
