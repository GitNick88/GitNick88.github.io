Back in December, 2019 I started my quest in Data Science at Lambda School with the hopes of moving out of the restaurant business and into the world of Data Science.

I've learned so much.  My best way of describing my Data Science experience at Lambda School is drinking from a fire hose.

That said, I've learned some really ammazing things.  I'm not talking about simply coding.  I'm talking about seeing how data science can change the world.
